## How to use

> [!NOTE]
> If you are on Nix, there is an example flake included
> otherwise feel free to `rm flake.nix`

- generate types with `ts-for-gir`

    ```sh
    # might take a while
    # also, don't worry about warning and error logs
    npx @ts-for-gir/cli generate --ignoreVersionConflicts
    ```

- developing

    ```sh
    meson setup build --wipe --prefix "$(pwd)/result"
    meson install -C build
    ./result/bin/simple-bar
    ```

- installing

    ```sh
    meson setup build --wipe --prefix /usr
    meson install -C build
    simple-bar
    ```

- adding new typescript files requires no additional steps
- adding new scss files requires no additional steps as long as they are imported from `main.scss`
- adding new ui (blueprint) files will also have to be listed in `meson.build` and in `gresource.xml`
